    Puzzle deletion and restarting implemented.  Need to complete
    PuzzleInfoActivity.

Date:   Sun May 5 19:12:11 2013 -0400

    Now new scanned grids (currently randomly generated) can be put in list
    of puzzles and completed.  Puzzles can be deleted from
    PuzzleListActivity, but should also be possible from the puzzle itself.
    Need to create PuzzleInfoActivity.

    Clues are now serializable.  The grids can also be different sizes.  A
    random grid is created when the camera is used now.  Next, need to
    implement saving grid so it is playable.

    Clues are now incorporated as part of the Grid class.  They are an
    across map and a down map of clue numbers to Strings.  The
    CompletePuzzleActivity pulls clues from these maps.

    Grid can now be set to read only so that users clicking on the view does
    nothing.  This is handy in the NamePuzzleActivity.

    Deletion of letters in Down clues fixed.  It is now possible to switch
    between down and across clues either by tapping the selected cell or by
    tapping the crossword clues (which are now correctly highlighted).

    Previous and next clue buttons implemented.  Also, deletion occurs in
    the right direction.  Next, I will work on generalizing the grid to any
    dimension size.

    Clue text fields implemented.  Need to make sure that deletion happens
    in the right direction.  Also, up/down buttons need to be implemented.

    One cell clues no longer treated as entries.  Implementing across and
    down clue text field next (w/o actual clues yet).

    correctly.  Need to resize keyboard and make sure that one cell entries
    are not treated as entries.

    changed, but still unable to deserialize on resume.
